Since this product is web based, it will utilize a standard Client/Server web architecture. On the front end it will be written using HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages and will connect to a back-end server using a client (browser) connected to the internet. It will also be designed to be responsive to all clients, (i.e., Mobile Friendly). The back-end will be written in Java and, as it is a global company and will require a robust and secure client/server relationship, it will utilize the Java Enterprise Edition Framework for the business logic. Requests will be implemented using the HTTP protocol and the server will use a SQL database. The strategy will be to keep it simple but to also allow for reusability and growth.
